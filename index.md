Hi there! Iâ€™m Sriharsha. Currently I am pursuing my research in aerospace
structures at [Queen's
University](https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofMechanicalandAerospaceEngineering/)
in Belfast. I am super interested in understanding how our world works and
coming up with solutions to its problems. I believe that we are in the cusp of a
new revolution in technology. With possibilities of artificial intelligence to
mass space transportation becoming a reality in the upcoming decades, we are
living in exciting times indeed! All these crazy stuff is going to change the
world faster than we think it is possible. I want to play my part, even if in a
small way, to make these changes happen. You can read more of my writing and
thoughts in my [blog](http://blog.sriharsha.space). Feel free to hit me up on
[twitter](http://twitter.com/sriharsha_space) or my
