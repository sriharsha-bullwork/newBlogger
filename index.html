  Hi there! Iâ€™m Sriharsha. Currently, I am pursuing my research in aerospace
  structures at
  <a
    href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofMechanicalandAerospaceEngineering/"
  >
    Queen's University
  </a>
  in Belfast. I am super interested in understanding how our world works and
  coming up with solutions to its problems. I believe that we are on the cusp of
  a new revolution in technology. With the possibilities of artificial
  intelligence and mass space transportation becoming a reality in the upcoming
  decades, we are living in exciting times indeed! All these crazy developments
  are going to change the world faster than we think is possible. I want to play
  my part, even if in a small way, to make these changes happen. You can read
  more of my writing and thoughts on my
